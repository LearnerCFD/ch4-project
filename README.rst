General purpose Lattice-Boltzmann code
=================

Introduction
============

A general purpose *Lattice-Boltzmann* code for fluid-dynamics simulations. It includes : 

- **fluid dynamics**  (with several volume forcing terms for Channel flow, Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence, buoyancy)
- **temperature dynamics** (advection, diffusion , sink/source or reaction terms)
- **phase change** (enthalpy formulation for solid/liquid systems)
- **scalar transport** (same functionalities as temperature)
- **lagrangian dynamics** (tracers, heavy/light & active  point-like particles; non-shperical Jeffrey rotation, gyrotaxis)
- **large eddy simulation** (Smagorinsky, Shear Improved Samgorinsky with Kalman Filter)

Requirements:

- MPI 
- HDF5 
- CMake (optional)
