General purpose Lattice-Boltzmann code
=================

Introduction
============

A general purpose Lattice-Boltzmann code for fluid-dynamics simulations. It includes : 

- fluid velocity dynamics  (with several volume forcing terms for Channel flow, Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence, buoyancy)
- temperature dynamics (advection, diffusion , sink/source or reaction terms)
- Phase change (enthalpy formulation for solid/liquid systems)
- scalar transport (same functionalities as temperature)
- lagrangian module (tracers, heavy/light & active  point-like particles; non-shperical Jeffrey rotation, gyrotaxis)
- LES module (Smagorinsky, Shear Improved Samgorinsky with Kalman Filter)

Requirements:
- MPI , HDF5 , CMake (optional)
